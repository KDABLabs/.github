# Introduction

KDABLabs is a collection of unsupported code written by
Klarälvdalens Datakonsult AB (KDAB) employees.

The KDABLabs repositories contain code associated with KDABTV,
blogs, demos, experimental ideas and other works-in-progress.

Feedback is accepted and appreciated but note that these
projects are not supported and may become obsolete over time.

Bug free, highly portable and maintainable code is not the goal;
essentially, the code is for demonstration purposes only.
